    "Legal Entity" shall mean the union of the acting entity and all
    other entities that control, are controlled by, or are under common

    direction or management of such entity, whether by contract or
    otherwise, or (ii) ownership of fifty percent (50%) or more of the
    outstanding shares, or (iii) beneficial ownership of such entity.

    "You" (or "Your") shall mean an individual or Legal Entity
    exercising permissions granted by this License.

    "Source" form shall mean the preferred form for making modifications,
    including but not limited to software source code, documentation
    source, and configuration files.

    "Object" form shall mean any form resulting from mechanical
    transformation or translation of a Source form, including but
    not limited to compiled object code, generated documentation,
    and conversions to other media types.

    "Work" shall mean the work of authorship, whether in Source or
    Object form, made available under the License, as indicated by a
    copyright notice that is included in or attached to the work
    (an example is provided in the Appendix below).

    "Derivative Works" shall mean any work, whether in Source or Object
    form, that is based on (or derived from) the Work and for which the
    editorial revisions, annotations, elaborations, or other modifications
    represent, as a whole, an original work of authorship. For the purposes
    of this License, Derivative Works shall not include works that remain
    separable from, or merely link (or bind by name) to the interfaces of,
    the Work and Derivative Works thereof.

    "Contribution" shall mean any work of authorship, including
    the original version of the Work and any modifications or additions

    the copyright owner. For the purposes of this definition, "submitted"
    means any form of electronic, verbal, or written communication sent
    to the Licensor or its representatives, including but not limited to
    communication on electronic mailing lists, source code control systems,
    and issue tracking systems that are managed by, or on behalf of, the
    Licensor for the purpose of discussing and improving the Work, but
    excluding communication that is conspicuously marked or otherwise
    designated in writing by the copyright owner as "Not a Contribution."

    "Contributor" shall mean Licensor and any individual or Legal Entity
    on behalf of whom a Contribution has been received by Licensor and
    subsequently incorporated within the Work.

 2. Grant of Copyright License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
    copyright license to reproduce, prepare Derivative Works of,
    publicly display, publicly perform, sublicense, and distribute the
    Work and such Derivative Works in Source or Object form.

 3. Grant of Patent License. Subject to the terms and conditions of
    this License, each Contributor hereby grants to You a perpetual,
    worldwide, non-exclusive, no-charge, royalty-free, irrevocable
    (except as stated in this section) patent license to make, have made,
    use, offer to sell, sell, import, and otherwise transfer the Work,
    where such license applies only to those patent claims licensable
    by such Contributor that are necessarily infringed by their
    Contribution(s) alone or by combination of their Contribution(s)
    with the Work to which such Contribution(s) was submitted. If You
    institute patent litigation against any entity (including a
    cross-claim or counterclaim in a lawsuit) alleging that the Work
    or a Contribution incorporated within the Work constitutes direct
    or contributory patent infringement, then any patent licenses
    granted to You under this License for that Work shall terminate
    as of the date such litigation is filed.

 4. Redistribution. You may reproduce and distribute copies of the
    Work or Derivative Works thereof in any medium, with or without
    modifications, and in Source or Object form, provided that You
    meet the following conditions:

    (a) You must give any other recipients of the Work or
        Derivative Works a copy of this License; and

    (b) You must cause any modified files to carry prominent notices
        stating that You changed the files; and

    (c) You must retain, in the Source form of any Derivative Works
        that You distribute, all copyright, patent, trademark, and
        attribution notices from the Source form of the Work,
        excluding those notices that do not pertain to any part of
        the Derivative Works; and

    (d) If the Work includes a "NOTICE" text file as part of its
        distribution, then any Derivative Works that You distribute must
        include a readable copy of the attribution notices contained
        within such NOTICE file, excluding those notices that do not
        pertain to any part of the Derivative Works, in at least one
        of the following places: within a NOTICE text file distributed
        as part of the Derivative Works; within the Source form or
        documentation, if provided along with the Derivative Works; or,
        within a display generated by the Derivative Works, if and
        wherever such third-party notices normally appear. The contents
        of the NOTICE file are for informational purposes only and
        do not modify the License. You may add Your own attribution
        notices within Derivative Works that You distribute, alongside
        or as an addendum to the NOTICE text from the Work, provided
        that such additional attribution notices cannot be construed
        as modifying the License.

    You may add Your own copyright statement to Your modifications and
    may provide additional or different license terms and conditions
    for use, reproduction, or distribution of Your modifications, or
    for any such Derivative Works as a whole, provided Your use,
    reproduction, and distribution of the Work otherwise complies with
    the conditions stated in this License.

 5. Submission of Contributions. Unless You explicitly state otherwise,
    any Contribution intentionally submitted for inclusion in the Work
    by You to the Licensor shall be under the terms and conditions of
    this License, without any additional terms or conditions.
    Notwithstanding the above, nothing herein shall supersede or modify
    the terms of any separate license agreement you may have executed
    with Licensor regarding such Contributions.

 6. Trademarks. This License does not grant permission to use the trade
    names, trademarks, service marks, or product names of the Licensor,
    except as required for reasonable and customary use in describing the
    origin of the Work and reproducing the content of the NOTICE file.

 7. Disclaimer of Warranty. Unless required by applicable law or
    agreed to in writing, Licensor provides the Work (and each
    Contributor provides its Contributions) on an "AS IS" BASIS,
    WITHOUT WARRANTIES OR CONDITIONS OF ANY KIND, either express or
    implied, including, without limitation, any warranties or conditions
    of TITLE, NON-INFRINGEMENT, MERCHANTABILITY, or FITNESS FOR A
    PARTICULAR PURPOSE. You are solely responsible for determining the
    appropriateness of using or redistributing the Work and assume any
    risks associated with Your exercise of permissions under this License.

 8. Limitation of Liability. In no event and under no legal theory,
    whether in tort (including negligence), contract, or otherwise,
    unless required by applicable law (such as deliberate and grossly
    negligent acts) or agreed to in writing, shall any Contributor be
    liable to You for damages, including any direct, indirect, special,
    incidental, or consequential damages of any character arising as a
    result of this License or out of the use or inability to use the
    Work (including but not limited to damages for loss of goodwill,
    work stoppage, computer failure or malfunction, or any and all
    other commercial damages or losses), even if such Contributor
    has been advised of the possibility of such damages.

 9. Accepting Warranty or Additional Liability. While redistributing
    the Work or Derivative Works thereof, You may choose to offer,
    and charge a fee for, acceptance of support, warranty, indemnity,
    or other liability obligations and/or rights consistent with this
    License. However, in accepting such obligations, You may act only
    on Your own behalf and on Your sole responsibility, not on behalf
    of any other Contributor, and only if You agree to indemnify,
    defend, and hold each Contributor harmless for any liability
    incurred by, or claims asserted against, such Contributor by reason
    of your accepting any such warranty or additional liability.

     * Invokes an execution of an Observable and registers Observer handlers for notifications it will emit.
     *
     * <span class="informal">Use it when you have all these Observables, but still nothing is happening.</span>
     *
     * `subscribe` is not a regular operator, but a method that calls Observable's internal `subscribe` function. It
     * might be for example a function that you passed to a {@link create} static factory, but most of the time it is
     * a library implementation, which defines what and when will be emitted by an Observable. This means that calling
     * `subscribe` is actually the moment when Observable starts its work, not when it is created, as it is often
     * thought.
     *
     * Apart from starting the execution of an Observable, this method allows you to listen for values
     * that an Observable emits, as well as for when it completes or errors. You can achieve this in two
     * following ways.
     *
     * The first way is creating an object that implements {@link Observer} interface. It should have methods
     * defined by that interface, but note that it should be just a regular JavaScript object, which you can create
     * yourself in any way you want (ES6 class, classic function constructor, object literal etc.). In particular do
     * not attempt to use any RxJS implementation details to create Observers - you don't need them. Remember also
     * that your object does not have to implement all methods. If you find yourself creating a method that doesn't
     * do anything, you can simply omit it. Note however, that if `error` method is not provided, all errors will
     * be left uncaught.
     *
     * The second way is to give up on Observer object altogether and simply provide callback functions in place of its methods.
     * This means you can provide three functions as arguments to `subscribe`, where first function is equivalent
     * of a `next` method, second of an `error` method and third of a `complete` method. Just as in case of Observer,
     * if you do not need to listen for something, you can omit a function, preferably by passing `undefined` or `null`,
     * since `subscribe` recognizes these functions by where they were placed in function call. When it comes
     * to `error` function, just as before, if not provided, errors emitted by an Observable will be thrown.
     *
     * Whatever style of calling `subscribe` you use, in both cases it returns a Subscription object.
     * This object allows you to call `unsubscribe` on it, which in turn will stop work that an Observable does and will clean
     * up all resources that an Observable used. Note that cancelling a subscription will not call `complete` callback
     * provided to `subscribe` function, which is reserved for a regular completion signal that comes from an Observable.
     *
     * Remember that callbacks provided to `subscribe` are not guaranteed to be called asynchronously.
     * It is an Observable itself that decides when these functions will be called. For example {@link of}
     * by default emits all its values synchronously. Always check documentation for how given Observable
     * will behave when subscribed and if its default behavior can be modified with a {@link Scheduler}.
     *
     * @example <caption>Subscribe with an Observer</caption>
     * const sumObserver = {
     *   sum: 0,
     *   next(value) {
     *     console.log('Adding: ' + value);
     *     this.sum = this.sum + value;
     *   },
     *   error() { // We actually could just remove this method,
     *   },        // since we do not really care about errors right now.
     *   complete() {
     *     console.log('Sum equals: ' + this.sum);
     *   }
     * };
     *
     * Rx.Observable.of(1, 2, 3) // Synchronously emits 1, 2, 3 and then completes.
     * .subscribe(sumObserver);
     *
     * // Logs:
     * // "Adding: 1"
     * // "Adding: 2"
     * // "Adding: 3"
     * // "Sum equals: 6"
     *
     *
     * @example <caption>Subscribe with functions</caption>
     * let sum = 0;
     *
     * Rx.Observable.of(1, 2, 3)
     * .subscribe(
     *   function(value) {
     *     console.log('Adding: ' + value);
     *     sum = sum + value;
     *   },
     *   undefined,
     *   function() {
     *     console.log('Sum equals: ' + sum);
     *   }

     * // Logs:
     * // "Adding: 1"
     * // "Adding: 2"
     * // "Adding: 3"
     * // "Sum equals: 6"
     *
     *
     * @example <caption>Cancel a subscription</caption>
     * const subscription = Rx.Observable.interval(1000).subscribe(
     *   num => console.log(num),
     *   undefined,
     *   () => console.log('completed!') // Will not be called, even

     *
     *
     * setTimeout(() => {
     *   subscription.unsubscribe();
     *   console.log('unsubscribed!');
     * }, 2500);

     * Converts a callback API to a function that returns an Observable.
     *
     * <span class="informal">Give it a function `f` of type `f(x, callback)` and
     * it will return a function `g` that when called as `g(x)` will output an
     * Observable.</span>
     *
     * `bindCallback` is not an operator because its input and output are not
     * Observables. The input is a function `func` with some parameters, the
     * last parameter must be a callback function that `func` calls when it is
     * done.
     *
     * The output of `bindCallback` is a function that takes the same parameters
     * as `func`, except the last one (the callback). When the output function
     * is called with arguments it will return an Observable. If function `func`
     * calls its callback with one argument the Observable will emit that value.
     * If on the other hand the callback is called with multiple values the resulting
     * Observable will emit an array with said values as arguments.
     *
     * It is very important to remember that input function `func` is not called
     * when the output function is, but rather when the Observable returned by the output
     * function is subscribed. This means if `func` makes an AJAX request, that request
     * will be made every time someone subscribes to the resulting Observable, but not before.
     *
     * Optionally, a selector function can be passed to `bindObservable`. The selector function
     * takes the same arguments as the callback and returns the value that will be emitted by the Observable.
     * Even though by default multiple arguments passed to callback appear in the stream as an array
     * the selector function will be called with arguments directly, just as the callback would.
     * This means you can imagine the default selector (when one is not provided explicitly)
     * as a function that aggregates all its arguments into an array, or simply returns first argument
     * if there is only one.
     *
     * The last optional parameter - {@link Scheduler} - can be used to control when the call
     * to `func` happens after someone subscribes to Observable, as well as when results
     * passed to callback will be emitted. By default, the subscription to  an Observable calls `func`
     * synchronously, but using `Scheduler.async` as the last parameter will defer the call to `func`,
     * just like wrapping the call in `setTimeout` with a timeout of `0` would. If you use the async Scheduler
     * and call `subscribe` on the output Observable all function calls that are currently executing
     * will end before `func` is invoked.
     *
     * By default results passed to the callback are emitted immediately after `func` invokes the callback.
     * In particular, if the callback is called synchronously the subscription of the resulting Observable
     * will call the `next` function synchronously as well.  If you want to defer that call,
     * you may use `Scheduler.async` just as before.  This means that by using `Scheduler.async` you can
     * ensure that `func` always calls its callback asynchronously, thus avoiding terrifying Zalgo.
     *
     * Note that the Observable created by the output function will always emit a single value
     * and then complete immediately. If `func` calls the callback multiple times, values from subsequent
     * calls will not appear in the stream. If you need to listen for multiple calls,
     *  you probably want to use {@link fromEvent} or {@link fromEventPattern} instead.
     *
     * If `func` depends on some context (`this` property) and is not already bound the context of `func`
     * will be the context that the output function has at call time. In particular, if `func`
     * is called as a method of some objec and if `func` is not already bound, in order to preserve the context
     * it is recommended that the context of the output function is set to that object as well.
     *
     * If the input function calls its callback in the "node style" (i.e. first argument to callback is
     * optional error parameter signaling whether the call failed or not), {@link bindNodeCallback}
     * provides convenient error handling and probably is a better choice.
     * `bindCallback` will treat such functions the same as any other and error parameters
     * (whether passed or not) will always be interpreted as regular callback argument.
     *
     *
     * @example <caption>Convert jQuery's getJSON to an Observable API</caption>
     * // Suppose we have jQuery.getJSON('/my/url', callback)
     * var getJSONAsObservable = Rx.Observable.bindCallback(jQuery.getJSON);
     * var result = getJSONAsObservable('/my/url');
     * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x), e => console.error(e));

     * Converts a Node.js-style callback API to a function that returns an
     * Observable.
     *
     * <span class="informal">It's just like {@link bindCallback}, but the
     * callback is expected to be of type `callback(error, result)`.</span>
     *
     * `bindNodeCallback` is not an operator because its input and output are not
     * Observables. The input is a function `func` with some parameters, but the
     * last parameter must be a callback function that `func` calls when it is
     * done. The callback function is expected to follow Node.js conventions,
     * where the first argument to the callback is an error object, signaling
     * whether call was successful. If that object is passed to callback, it means
     * something went wrong.
     *
     * The output of `bindNodeCallback` is a function that takes the same
     * parameters as `func`, except the last one (the callback). When the output
     * function is called with arguments, it will return an Observable.
     * If `func` calls its callback with error parameter present, Observable will
     * error with that value as well. If error parameter is not passed, Observable will emit
     * second parameter. If there are more parameters (third and so on),
     * Observable will emit an array with all arguments, except first error argument.
     *
     * Optionally `bindNodeCallback` accepts selector function, which allows you to
     * make resulting Observable emit value computed by selector, instead of regular
     * callback arguments. It works similarly to {@link bindCallback} selector, but
     * Node.js-style error argument will never be passed to that function.
     *
     * Note that `func` will not be called at the same time output function is,
     * but rather whenever resulting Observable is subscribed. By default call to
     * `func` will happen synchronously after subscription, but that can be changed
     * with proper {@link Scheduler} provided as optional third parameter. Scheduler
     * can also control when values from callback will be emitted by Observable.
     * To find out more, check out documentation for {@link bindCallback}, where
     * Scheduler works exactly the same.
     *
     * As in {@link bindCallback}, context (`this` property) of input function will be set to context
     * of returned function, when it is called.
     *
     * After Observable emits value, it will complete immediately. This means
     * even if `func` calls callback again, values from second and consecutive
     * calls will never appear on the stream. If you need to handle functions
     * that call callbacks multiple times, check out {@link fromEvent} or
     * {@link fromEventPattern} instead.
     *
     * Note that `bindNodeCallback` can be used in non-Node.js environments as well.
     * "Node.js-style" callbacks are just a convention, so if you write for
     * browsers or any other environment and API you use implements that callback style,
     * `bindNodeCallback` can be safely used on that API functions as well.
     *
     * Remember that Error object passed to callback does not have to be an instance
     * of JavaScript built-in `Error` object. In fact, it does not even have to an object.
     * Error parameter of callback function is interpreted as "present", when value
     * of that parameter is truthy. It could be, for example, non-zero number, non-empty
     * string or boolean `true`. In all of these cases resulting Observable would error
     * with that value. This means usually regular style callbacks will fail very often when
     * `bindNodeCallback` is used. If your Observable errors much more often then you
     * would expect, check if callback really is called in Node.js-style and, if not,
     * switch to {@link bindCallback} instead.
     *
     * Note that even if error parameter is technically present in callback, but its value
     * is falsy, it still won't appear in array emitted by Observable or in selector function.
     *
     *
     * @example <caption>Read a file from the filesystem and get the data as an Observable</caption>
     * import * as fs from 'fs';
     * var readFileAsObservable = Rx.Observable.bindNodeCallback(fs.readFile);
     * var result = readFileAsObservable('./roadNames.txt', 'utf8');
     * result.subscribe(x => console.log(x), e => console.error(e));

/**
 * Combines multiple Observables to create an Observable whose values are
 * calculated from the latest values of each of its input Observables.
 *
 * <span class="informal">Whenever any input Observable emits a value, it
 * computes a formula using the latest values from all the inputs, then emits
 * the output of that formula.</span>
 *
 * <img src="./img/combineLatest.png" width="100%">
 *
 * `combineLatest` combines the values from all the Observables passed as
 * arguments. This is done by subscribing to each Observable in order and,
 * whenever any Observable emits, collecting an array of the most recent
 * values from each Observable. So if you pass `n` Observables to operator,
 * returned Observable will always emit an array of `n` values, in order
 * corresponding to order of passed Observables (value from the first Observable
 * on the first place and so on).
 *
 * Static version of `combineLatest` accepts either an array of Observables
 * or each Observable can be put directly as an argument. Note that array of
 * Observables is good choice, if you don't know beforehand how many Observables
 * you will combine. Passing empty array will result in Observable that
 * completes immediately.
 *
 * To ensure output array has always the same length, `combineLatest` will
 * actually wait for all input Observables to emit at least once,
 * before it starts emitting results. This means if some Observable emits
 * values before other Observables started emitting, all that values but last
 * will be lost. On the other hand, is some Observable does not emit value but
 * completes, resulting Observable will complete at the same moment without
 * emitting anything, since it will be now impossible to include value from
 * completed Observable in resulting array. Also, if some input Observable does
 * not emit any value and never completes, `combineLatest` will also never emit
 * and never complete, since, again, it will wait for all streams to emit some
 * value.
 *
 * If at least one Observable was passed to `combineLatest` and all passed Observables
 * emitted something, resulting Observable will complete when all combined
 * streams complete. So even if some Observable completes, result of
 * `combineLatest` will still emit values when other Observables do. In case
 * of completed Observable, its value from now on will always be the last
 * emitted value. On the other hand, if any Observable errors, `combineLatest`
 * will error immediately as well, and all other Observables will be unsubscribed.
 *
 * `combineLatest` accepts as optional parameter `project` function, which takes
 * as arguments all values that would normally be emitted by resulting Observable.
 * `project` can return any kind of value, which will be then emitted by Observable
 * instead of default array. Note that `project` does not take as argument that array
 * of values, but values themselves. That means default `project` can be imagined
 * as function that takes all its arguments and puts them into an array.
 *
 *
 * @example <caption>Combine two timer Observables</caption>
 * const firstTimer = Rx.Observable.timer(0, 1000); // emit 0, 1, 2... after every second, starting from now
 * const secondTimer = Rx.Observable.timer(500, 1000); // emit 0, 1, 2... after every second, starting 0,5s from now
 * const combinedTimers = Rx.Observable.combineLatest(firstTimer, secondTimer);
 * combinedTimers.subscribe(value => console.log(value));
 * // Logs
 * // [0, 0] after 0.5s
 * // [1, 0] after 1s
 * // [1, 1] after 1.5s
 * // [2, 1] after 2s
 *
 *
 * @example <caption>Combine an array of Observables</caption>
 * const observables = [1, 5, 10].map(
 *   n => Rx.Observable.of(n).delay(n * 1000).startWith(0) // emit 0 and then emit n after n seconds
 * );
 * const combined = Rx.Observable.combineLatest(observables);
 * combined.subscribe(value => console.log(value));
 * // Logs
 * // [0, 0, 0] immediately
 * // [1, 0, 0] after 1s
 * // [1, 5, 0] after 5s
 * // [1, 5, 10] after 10s
 *
 *
 * @example <caption>Use project function to dynamically calculate the Body-Mass Index</caption>
 * var weight = Rx.Observable.of(70, 72, 76, 79, 75);
 * var height = Rx.Observable.of(1.76, 1.77, 1.78);

/**
 *
 * Re-emits all notifications from source Observable with specified scheduler.
 *
 * <span class="informal">Ensure a specific scheduler is used, from outside of an Observable.</span>
 *
 * `observeOn` is an operator that accepts a scheduler as a first parameter, which will be used to reschedule
 * notifications emitted by the source Observable. It might be useful, if you do not have control over
 * internal scheduler of a given Observable, but want to control when its values are emitted nevertheless.
 *
 * Returned Observable emits the same notifications (nexted values, complete and error events) as the source Observable,
 * but rescheduled with provided scheduler. Note that this doesn't mean that source Observables internal
 * scheduler will be replaced in any way. Original scheduler still will be used, but when the source Observable emits
 * notification, it will be immediately scheduled again - this time with scheduler passed to `observeOn`.
 * An anti-pattern would be calling `observeOn` on Observable that emits lots of values synchronously, to split
 * that emissions into asynchronous chunks. For this to happen, scheduler would have to be passed into the source
 * Observable directly (usually into the operator that creates it). `observeOn` simply delays notifications a
 * little bit more, to ensure that they are emitted at expected moments.
 *
 * As a matter of fact, `observeOn` accepts second parameter, which specifies in milliseconds with what delay notifications
 * will be emitted. The main difference between {@link delay} operator and `observeOn` is that `observeOn`
 * will delay all notifications - including error notifications - while `delay` will pass through error
 * from source Observable immediately when it is emitted. In general it is highly recommended to use `delay` operator
 * for any kind of delaying of values in the stream, while using `observeOn` to specify which scheduler should be used
 * for notification emissions in general.
 *
 * @example <caption>Ensure values in subscribe are called just before browser repaint.</caption>
 * const intervals = Rx.Observable.interval(10); // Intervals are scheduled
 *                                               // with async scheduler by default...
 *
 * intervals
 * .observeOn(Rx.Scheduler.animationFrame)       // ...but we will observe on animationFrame
 * .subscribe(val => {                           // scheduler to ensure smooth animation.
 *   someDiv.style.height = val + 'px';
 * });
 *
 * @see {@link delay}
 *
 * @param {IScheduler} scheduler Scheduler that will be used to reschedule notifications from source Observable.
 * @param {number} [delay] Number of milliseconds that states with what delay every notification should be rescheduled.
 * @return {Observable<T>} Observable that emits the same notifications as the source Observable,

 *
 * <img src="./img/concat.png" width="100%">
 *
 * `concat` joins multiple Observables together, by subscribing to them one at a time and
 * merging their results into the output Observable. You can pass either an array of
 * Observables, or put them directly as arguments. Passing an empty array will result
 * in Observable that completes immediately.
 *
 * `concat` will subscribe to first input Observable and emit all its values, without
 * changing or affecting them in any way. When that Observable completes, it will
 * subscribe to then next Observable passed and, again, emit its values. This will be
 * repeated, until the operator runs out of Observables. When last input Observable completes,
 * `concat` will complete as well. At any given moment only one Observable passed to operator
 * emits values. If you would like to emit values from passed Observables concurrently, check out
 * {@link merge} instead, especially with optional `concurrent` parameter. As a matter of fact,
 * `concat` is an equivalent of `merge` operator with `concurrent` parameter set to `1`.
 *
 * Note that if some input Observable never completes, `concat` will also never complete
 * and Observables following the one that did not complete will never be subscribed. On the other
 * hand, if some Observable simply completes immediately after it is subscribed, it will be
 * invisible for `concat`, which will just move on to the next Observable.
 *
 * If any Observable in chain errors, instead of passing control to the next Observable,
 * `concat` will error immediately as well. Observables that would be subscribed after
 * the one that emitted error, never will.
 *
 * If you pass to `concat` the same Observable many times, its stream of values
 * will be "replayed" on every subscription, which means you can repeat given Observable
 * as many times as you like. If passing the same Observable to `concat` 1000 times becomes tedious,
 * you can always use {@link repeat}.
 *
 * @example <caption>Concatenate a timer counting from 0 to 3 with a synchronous sequence from 1 to 10</caption>
 * var timer = Rx.Observable.interval(1000).take(4);
 * var sequence = Rx.Observable.range(1, 10);

     *
     * `forkJoin` is an operator that takes any number of Observables which can be passed either as an array
     * or directly as arguments. If no input Observables are provided, resulting stream will complete
     * immediately.
     *
     * `forkJoin` will wait for all passed Observables to complete and then it will emit an array with last
     * values from corresponding Observables. So if you pass `n` Observables to the operator, resulting
     * array will have `n` values, where first value is the last thing emitted by the first Observable,
     * second value is the last thing emitted by the second Observable and so on. That means `forkJoin` will
     * not emit more than once and it will complete after that. If you need to emit combined values not only
     * at the end of lifecycle of passed Observables, but also throughout it, try out {@link combineLatest}
     * or {@link zip} instead.
     *
     * In order for resulting array to have the same length as the number of input Observables, whenever any of
     * that Observables completes without emitting any value, `forkJoin` will complete at that moment as well
     * and it will not emit anything either, even if it already has some last values from other Observables.
     * Conversely, if there is an Observable that never completes, `forkJoin` will never complete as well,
     * unless at any point some other Observable completes without emitting value, which brings us back to
     * the previous case. Overall, in order for `forkJoin` to emit a value, all Observables passed as arguments
     * have to emit something at least once and complete.
     *
     * If any input Observable errors at some point, `forkJoin` will error as well and all other Observables
     * will be immediately unsubscribed.
     *
     * Optionally `forkJoin` accepts project function, that will be called with values which normally
     * would land in emitted array. Whatever is returned by project function, will appear in output
     * Observable instead. This means that default project can be thought of as a function that takes
     * all its arguments and puts them into an array. Note that project function will be called only
     * when output Observable is supposed to emit a result.

     *

     * EventEmitter events or others.</span>
     *
     * <img src="./img/fromEvent.png" width="100%">
     *
     * `fromEvent` accepts as a first argument event target, which is an object with methods
     * for registering event handler functions. As a second argument it takes string that indicates
     * type of event we want to listen for. `fromEvent` supports selected types of event targets,
     * which are described in detail below. If your event target does not match any of the ones listed,
     * you should use {@link fromEventPattern}, which can be used on arbitrary APIs.
     * When it comes to APIs supported by `fromEvent`, their methods for adding and removing event
     * handler functions have different names, but they all accept a string describing event type
     * and function itself, which will be called whenever said event happens.
     *
     * Every time resulting Observable is subscribed, event handler function will be registered
     * to event target on given event type. When that event fires, value
     * passed as a first argument to registered function will be emitted by output Observable.
     * When Observable is unsubscribed, function will be unregistered from event target.
     *
     * Note that if event target calls registered function with more than one argument, second
     * and following arguments will not appear in resulting stream. In order to get access to them,
     * you can pass to `fromEvent` optional project function, which will be called with all arguments
     * passed to event handler. Output Observable will then emit value returned by project function,
     * instead of the usual value.
     *
     * Remember that event targets listed below are checked via duck typing. It means that
     * no matter what kind of object you have and no matter what environment you work in,
     * you can safely use `fromEvent` on that object if it exposes described methods (provided
     * of course they behave as was described above). So for example if Node.js library exposes
     * event target which has the same method names as DOM EventTarget, `fromEvent` is still
     * a good choice.
     *
     * If the API you use is more callback then event handler oriented (subscribed
     * callback function fires only once and thus there is no need to manually
     * unregister it), you should use {@link bindCallback} or {@link bindNodeCallback}
     * instead.
     *
     * `fromEvent` supports following types of event targets:
     *
     * **DOM EventTarget**
     *
     * This is an object with `addEventListener` and `removeEventListener` methods.
     *
     * In the browser, `addEventListener` accepts - apart from event type string and event
     * handler function arguments - optional third parameter, which is either an object or boolean,
     * both used for additional configuration how and when passed function will be called. When
     * `fromEvent` is used with event target of that type, you can provide this values
     * as third parameter as well.
     *
     * **Node.js EventEmitter**
     *
     * An object with `addListener` and `removeListener` methods.
     *
     * **JQuery-style event target**
     *
     * An object with `on` and `off` methods
     *
     * **DOM NodeList**
     *
     * List of DOM Nodes, returned for example by `document.querySelectorAll` or `Node.childNodes`.
     *
     * Although this collection is not event target in itself, `fromEvent` will iterate over all Nodes
     * it contains and install event handler function in every of them. When returned Observable
     * is unsubscribed, function will be removed from all Nodes.
     *
     * **DOM HtmlCollection**
     *
     * Just as in case of NodeList it is a collection of DOM nodes. Here as well event handler function is
     * installed and removed in each of elements.
     *
     *
     * @example <caption>Emits clicks happening on the DOM document</caption>
     * var clicks = Rx.Observable.fromEvent(document, 'click');
     * clicks.subscribe(x => console.log(x));
     *
     * // Results in:
     * // MouseEvent object logged to console every time a click
     * // occurs on the document.
     *
     *
     * @example <caption>Use addEventListener with capture option</caption>
     * var clicksInDocument = Rx.Observable.fromEvent(document, 'click', true); // note optional configuration parameter
     *                                                                          // which will be passed to addEventListener

 *
 * <img src="./img/onErrorResumeNext.png" width="100%">
 *
 * `onErrorResumeNext` is an operator that accepts a series of Observables, provided either directly as
 * arguments or as an array. If no single Observable is provided, returned Observable will simply behave the same
 * as the source.
 *
 * `onErrorResumeNext` returns an Observable that starts by subscribing and re-emitting values from the source Observable.
 * When its stream of values ends - no matter if Observable completed or emitted an error - `onErrorResumeNext`
 * will subscribe to the first Observable that was passed as an argument to the method. It will start re-emitting
 * its values as well and - again - when that stream ends, `onErrorResumeNext` will proceed to subscribing yet another
 * Observable in provided series, no matter if previous Observable completed or ended with an error. This will
 * be happening until there is no more Observables left in the series, at which point returned Observable will
 * complete - even if the last subscribed stream ended with an error.
 *
 * `onErrorResumeNext` can be therefore thought of as version of {@link concat} operator, which is more permissive
 * when it comes to the errors emitted by its input Observables. While `concat` subscribes to the next Observable
 * in series only if previous one successfully completed, `onErrorResumeNext` subscribes even if it ended with
 * an error.
 *
 * Note that you do not get any access to errors emitted by the Observables. In particular do not
 * expect these errors to appear in error callback passed to {@link subscribe}. If you want to take
 * specific actions based on what error was emitted by an Observable, you should try out {@link catch} instead.
 *
 *
 * @example <caption>Subscribe to the next Observable after map fails</caption>
 * Rx.Observable.of(1, 2, 3, 0)
 *   .map(x => {
 *       if (x === 0) { throw Error(); }
         return 10 / x;
 *   })
 *   .onErrorResumeNext(Rx.Observable.of(1, 2, 3))
 *   .subscribe(
 *     val => console.log(val),
 *     err => console.log(err),          // Will never be called.
 *     () => console.log('that\'s it!')
 *   );
 *
 * // Logs:
 * // 10
 * // 5
 * // 3.3333333333333335

 * Queue Scheduler

 * <span class="informal">Put every next task on a queue, instead of executing it immediately</span>
 *
 * `queue` scheduler, when used with delay, behaves the same as {@link async} scheduler.
 *
 * When used without delay, it schedules given task synchronously - executes it right when
 * it is scheduled. However when called recursively, that is when inside the scheduled task,
 * another task is scheduled with queue scheduler, instead of executing immediately as well,
 * that task will be put on a queue and wait for current one to finish.
 *
 * This means that when you execute task with `queue` scheduler, you are sure it will end
 * before any other task scheduled with that scheduler will start.
 *
 * @examples <caption>Schedule recursively first, then do something</caption>
 *
 * Rx.Scheduler.queue.schedule(() => {
 *   Rx.Scheduler.queue.schedule(() => console.log('second')); // will not happen now, but will be put on a queue
 *
 *   console.log('first');
 * });
 *
 * // Logs:
 * // "first"
 * // "second"
 *
 *
 * @example <caption>Reschedule itself recursively</caption>
 *
 * Rx.Scheduler.queue.schedule(function(state) {
 *   if (state !== 0) {
 *     console.log('before', state);
 *     this.schedule(state - 1); // `this` references currently executing Action,
 *                               // which we reschedule with new state
 *     console.log('after', state);
 *   }
 * }, 0, 3);
 *
 * // In scheduler that runs recursively, you would expect:
 * // "before", 3
 * // "before", 2
 * // "before", 1
 * // "after", 1
 * // "after", 2
 * // "after", 3
 *
 * // But with queue it logs:

/**
 * Allows source Observable to be subscribed only once with a Subject of choice,

 *
 * <span class="informal">Subscribe to Observable once, but send its values to multiple subscribers.</span>
 *
 * <img src="./img/multicast.png" width="100%">
 *
 * `multicast` is an operator that works in two modes.
 *
 * In the first mode you provide a single argument to it, which can be either an initialized Subject or a Subject
 * factory. As a result you will get a special kind of an Observable - a {@link ConnectableObservable}. It can be
 * subscribed multiple times, just as regular Observable, but it won't subscribe to the source Observable at that
 * moment. It will do it only if you call its `connect` method. This means you can essentially control by hand, when
 * source Observable will be actually subscribed. What is more, ConnectableObservable will share this one subscription
 * between all of its subscribers. This means that, for example, `ajax` Observable will only send a request once,
 * even though usually it would send a request per every subscriber. Since it sends a request at the moment of
 * subscription, here request would be sent when the `connect` method of a ConnectableObservable is called.
 *
 * The most common pattern of using ConnectableObservable is calling `connect` when the first consumer subscribes,
 * keeping the subscription alive while several consumers come and go and finally unsubscribing from the source
 * Observable, when the last consumer unsubscribes. To not implement that logic over and over again,
 * ConnectableObservable has a special operator, `refCount`. When called, it returns an Observable, which will count
 * the number of consumers subscribed to it and keep ConnectableObservable connected as long as there is at least
 * one consumer. So if you don't actually need to decide yourself when to connect and disconnect a
 * ConnectableObservable, use `refCount`.
 *
 * The second mode is invoked by calling `multicast` with an additional, second argument - selector function.
 * This function accepts an Observable - which basically mirrors the source Observable - and returns Observable
 * as well, which should be the input stream modified by any operators you want. Note that in this
 * mode you cannot provide initialized Subject as a first argument - it has to be a Subject factory. If
 * you provide selector function, `multicast` returns just a regular Observable, instead of ConnectableObservable.
 * Thus, as usual, each subscription to this stream triggers subscription to the source Observable. However,
 * if inside the selector function you subscribe to the input Observable multiple times, actual source stream
 * will be subscribed only once. So if you have a chain of operators that use some Observable many times,
 * but you want to subscribe to that Observable only once, this is the mode you would use.
 *
 * Subject provided as a first parameter of `multicast` is used as a proxy for the single subscription to the
 * source Observable. It means that all values from the source stream go through that Subject. Thus, if a Subject
 * has some special properties, Observable returned by `multicast` will have them as well. If you want to use
 * `multicast` with a Subject that is one of the ones included in RxJS by default - {@link Subject},
 * {@link AsyncSubject}, {@link BehaviorSubject}, or {@link ReplaySubject} - simply use {@link publish},
 * {@link publishLast}, {@link publishBehavior} or {@link publishReplay} respectively. These are actually
 * just wrappers around `multicast`, with a specific Subject hardcoded inside.
 *
 * Also, if you use {@link publish} or {@link publishReplay} with a ConnectableObservables `refCount` operator,
 * you can simply use {@link share} and {@link shareReplay} respectively, which chain these two.
 *
 * @example <caption>Use ConnectableObservable</caption>
 * const seconds = Rx.Observable.interval(1000);
 * const connectableSeconds = seconds.multicast(new Subject());
 *
 * connectableSeconds.subscribe(value => console.log('first: ' + value));
 * connectableSeconds.subscribe(value => console.log('second: ' + value));
 *
 * // At this point still nothing happens, even though we subscribed twice.
 *
 * connectableSeconds.connect();
 *
 * // From now on `seconds` are being logged to the console,
 * // twice per every second. `seconds` Observable was however only subscribed once,
 * // so under the hood Observable.interval had only one clock started.
 *
 * @example <caption>Use selector</caption>
 * const seconds = Rx.Observable.interval(1000);
 *
 * seconds
 *     .multicast(
 *         () => new Subject(),
 *         seconds => seconds.zip(seconds) // Usually zip would subscribe to `seconds` twice.
 *                                         // Because we are inside selector, `seconds` is subscribed once,
 *     )                                   // thus starting only one clock used internally by Observable.interval.

 * Re-emits all notifications from source Observable with specified scheduler.
 *
 * <span class="informal">Ensure a specific scheduler is used, from outside of an Observable.</span>
 *
 * `observeOn` is an operator that accepts a scheduler as a first parameter, which will be used to reschedule
 * notifications emitted by the source Observable. It might be useful, if you do not have control over
 * internal scheduler of a given Observable, but want to control when its values are emitted nevertheless.
 *
 * Returned Observable emits the same notifications (nexted values, complete and error events) as the source Observable,
 * but rescheduled with provided scheduler. Note that this doesn't mean that source Observables internal
 * scheduler will be replaced in any way. Original scheduler still will be used, but when the source Observable emits
 * notification, it will be immediately scheduled again - this time with scheduler passed to `observeOn`.
 * An anti-pattern would be calling `observeOn` on Observable that emits lots of values synchronously, to split
 * that emissions into asynchronous chunks. For this to happen, scheduler would have to be passed into the source
 * Observable directly (usually into the operator that creates it). `observeOn` simply delays notifications a
 * little bit more, to ensure that they are emitted at expected moments.
 *
 * As a matter of fact, `observeOn` accepts second parameter, which specifies in milliseconds with what delay notifications
 * will be emitted. The main difference between {@link delay} operator and `observeOn` is that `observeOn`
 * will delay all notifications - including error notifications - while `delay` will pass through error
 * from source Observable immediately when it is emitted. In general it is highly recommended to use `delay` operator
 * for any kind of delaying of values in the stream, while using `observeOn` to specify which scheduler should be used
 * for notification emissions in general.
 *
 * @example <caption>Ensure values in subscribe are called just before browser repaint.</caption>
 * const intervals = Rx.Observable.interval(10); // Intervals are scheduled
 *                                               // with async scheduler by default...
 *
 * intervals
 * .observeOn(Rx.Scheduler.animationFrame)       // ...but we will observe on animationFrame
 * .subscribe(val => {                           // scheduler to ensure smooth animation.
 *   someDiv.style.height = val + 'px';
 * });
 *
 * @see {@link delay}

 *
 * <img src="./img/onErrorResumeNext.png" width="100%">
 *
 * `onErrorResumeNext` is an operator that accepts a series of Observables, provided either directly as
 * arguments or as an array. If no single Observable is provided, returned Observable will simply behave the same
 * as the source.
 *
 * `onErrorResumeNext` returns an Observable that starts by subscribing and re-emitting values from the source Observable.
 * When its stream of values ends - no matter if Observable completed or emitted an error - `onErrorResumeNext`
 * will subscribe to the first Observable that was passed as an argument to the method. It will start re-emitting
 * its values as well and - again - when that stream ends, `onErrorResumeNext` will proceed to subscribing yet another
 * Observable in provided series, no matter if previous Observable completed or ended with an error. This will
 * be happening until there is no more Observables left in the series, at which point returned Observable will
 * complete - even if the last subscribed stream ended with an error.
 *
 * `onErrorResumeNext` can be therefore thought of as version of {@link concat} operator, which is more permissive
 * when it comes to the errors emitted by its input Observables. While `concat` subscribes to the next Observable
 * in series only if previous one successfully completed, `onErrorResumeNext` subscribes even if it ended with
 * an error.
 *
 * Note that you do not get any access to errors emitted by the Observables. In particular do not
 * expect these errors to appear in error callback passed to {@link subscribe}. If you want to take
 * specific actions based on what error was emitted by an Observable, you should try out {@link catch} instead.

 *
 * `sequenceEqual` subscribes to two observables and buffers incoming values from each observable. Whenever either
 * observable emits a value, the value is buffered and the buffers are shifted and compared from the bottom
 * up; If any value pair doesn't match, the returned observable will emit `false` and complete. If one of the
 * observables completes, the operator will wait for the other observable to complete; If the other
 * observable emits before completing, the returned observable will emit `false` and complete. If one observable never
 * completes or emits after the other complets, the returned observable will never complete.

 * Asap Scheduler

 *
 * `asap` scheduler behaves the same as {@link async} scheduler when you use it to delay task
 * in time. If however you set delay to `0`, `asap` will wait for current synchronously executing
 * code to end and then it will try to execute given task as fast as possible.
 *
 * `asap` scheduler will do its best to minimize time between end of currently executing code
 * and start of scheduled task. This makes it best candidate for performing so called "deferring".
 * Traditionally this was achieved by calling `setTimeout(deferredTask, 0)`, but that technique involves
 * some (although minimal) unwanted delay.
 *
 * Note that using `asap` scheduler does not necessarily mean that your task will be first to process
 * after currently executing code. In particular, if some task was also scheduled with `asap` before,
 * that task will execute first. That being said, if you need to schedule task asynchronously, but
 * as soon as possible, `asap` scheduler is your best bet.
 *
 * @example <caption>Compare async and asap scheduler</caption>
 *
 * Rx.Scheduler.async.schedule(() => console.log('async')); // scheduling 'async' first...
 * Rx.Scheduler.asap.schedule(() => console.log('asap'));
 *
 * // Logs:
 * // "asap"
 * // "async"
 * // ... but 'asap' goes first!

 *
 * `timeout` operator accepts as an argument either a number or a Date.
 *
 * If number was provided, it returns an Observable that behaves like a source
 * Observable, unless there is a period of time where there is no value emitted.
 * So if you provide `100` as argument and first value comes after 50ms from
 * the moment of subscription, this value will be simply re-emitted by the resulting
 * Observable. If however after that 100ms passes without a second value being emitted,
 * stream will end with an error and source Observable will be unsubscribed.
 * These checks are performed throughout whole lifecycle of Observable - from the moment
 * it was subscribed to, until it completes or errors itself. Thus every value must be
 * emitted within specified period since previous value.
 *
 * If provided argument was Date, returned Observable behaves differently. It throws
 * if Observable did not complete before provided Date. This means that periods between
 * emission of particular values do not matter in this case. If Observable did not complete
 * before provided Date, source Observable will be unsubscribed. Other than that, resulting
 * stream behaves just as source Observable.
 *
 * `timeout` accepts also a Scheduler as a second parameter. It is used to schedule moment (or moments)
 * when returned Observable will check if source stream emitted value or completed.
 *
 * @example <caption>Check if ticks are emitted within certain timespan</caption>
 * const seconds = Rx.Observable.interval(1000);
 *
 * seconds.timeout(1100) // Let's use bigger timespan to be safe,
 *                       // since `interval` might fire a bit later then scheduled.
 * .subscribe(
 *     value => console.log(value), // Will emit numbers just as regular `interval` would.
 *     err => console.log(err) // Will never be called.
 * );
 *
 * seconds.timeout(900).subscribe(
 *     value => console.log(value), // Will never be called.
 *     err => console.log(err) // Will emit error before even first value is emitted,
 *                             // since it did not arrive within 900ms period.
 * );
 *
 * @example <caption>Use Date to check if Observable completed</caption>
 * const seconds = Rx.Observable.interval(1000);
 *
 * seconds.timeout(new Date("December 17, 2020 03:24:00"))
 * .subscribe(
 *     value => console.log(value), // Will emit values as regular `interval` would
 *                                  // until December 17, 2020 at 03:24:00.
 *     err => console.log(err) // On December 17, 2020 at 03:24:00 it will emit an error,
 *                             // since Observable did not complete by then.

 *
 * <img src="./img/timeout.png" width="100%">
 *
 * `timeout` operator accepts as an argument either a number or a Date.
 *
 * If number was provided, it returns an Observable that behaves like a source
 * Observable, unless there is a period of time where there is no value emitted.
 * So if you provide `100` as argument and first value comes after 50ms from
 * the moment of subscription, this value will be simply re-emitted by the resulting
 * Observable. If however after that 100ms passes without a second value being emitted,
 * stream will end with an error and source Observable will be unsubscribed.
 * These checks are performed throughout whole lifecycle of Observable - from the moment
 * it was subscribed to, until it completes or errors itself. Thus every value must be
 * emitted within specified period since previous value.
 *
 * If provided argument was Date, returned Observable behaves differently. It throws
 * if Observable did not complete before provided Date. This means that periods between
 * emission of particular values do not matter in this case. If Observable did not complete
 * before provided Date, source Observable will be unsubscribed. Other than that, resulting
 * stream behaves just as source Observable.
 *
 * `timeout` accepts also a Scheduler as a second parameter. It is used to schedule moment (or moments)
 * when returned Observable will check if source stream emitted value or completed.
 *
 * @example <caption>Check if ticks are emitted within certain timespan</caption>
 * const seconds = Rx.Observable.interval(1000);
 *
 * seconds.timeout(1100) // Let's use bigger timespan to be safe,
 *                       // since `interval` might fire a bit later then scheduled.
 * .subscribe(
 *     value => console.log(value), // Will emit numbers just as regular `interval` would.
 *     err => console.log(err) // Will never be called.
 * );
 *
 * seconds.timeout(900).subscribe(
 *     value => console.log(value), // Will never be called.
 *     err => console.log(err) // Will emit error before even first value is emitted,
 *                             // since it did not arrive within 900ms period.
 * );
 *
 * @example <caption>Use Date to check if Observable completed</caption>
 * const seconds = Rx.Observable.interval(1000);
 *
 * seconds.timeout(new Date("December 17, 2020 03:24:00"))
 * .subscribe(
 *     value => console.log(value), // Will emit values as regular `interval` would
 *                                  // until December 17, 2020 at 03:24:00.
 *     err => console.log(err) // On December 17, 2020 at 03:24:00 it will emit an error,
 *                             // since Observable did not complete by then.
